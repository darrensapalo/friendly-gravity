Friendly Gravity
================

A black hole finds morality.

You're a **good black hole**! Keep every thing alive or existent to gain more points! In other words, don't suck them into the black hole!

Each object in space (asteroids, comets, planets) is a score multiplier!

Get as much points within thirty (30) seconds. You can tap `Spacebar`  to push others away using a shockwave pulse!

Controls are `left`, `right`, `up`, and `down` keys.
