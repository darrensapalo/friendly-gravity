Friendly Gravity
================

You're a _good_ black hole! Keep every thing alive or existent to gain more points! In other words, don't suck them into the black hole! Each object in space (asteroids, comets, planets) is a score multiplier! Keep'em alive to gain more points!

The goal of the game is to get as much points within thirty (30) seconds. You can tap **Spacebar** to push others away using a shockwave pulse!

To move, Use the **left, right, up, and down** arrow keys. You can also use the **WASD** keys.
